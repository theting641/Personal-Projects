# Personal-Projects
Personal coding project that I am working on

This project was something that I had been interested in for a while. I took data found online from Yahoo sports and other
fantasy sites and compiled the data into a SQL dataframe. Currently, the code takes the data and formulates it into a panda 
dataframe. The data has then been transfered into an SQL database. 

Currently, I am trying to create a more expansive database. Also, I am working on making a mock scripting program so I can 
compare what my data is to my actual drafted team that I have.

Note: I took a lot of inspiration from https://fantasypython.co/ especially with taking the code and forming it into the 
initial dataframe.
